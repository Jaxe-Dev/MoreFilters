  <description>Mod Version: {ReleaseVersion}\n\nThis mod adds several new filters to item lists to make it easier to customize your stockpiles and bills.\n\nCurrently, the following filters can be selected/deselected:\n\n*Rottable (all items that can rot unless frozen)\n*Degradable (all items that will deteriorate unless under shelter)\n\nAlso for Weapons and Apparel, filters are added for each tech level so for example you can quickly make a Smelt Weapon bill that only affects medieval weapons.\n\nFinally, additional filters are available for food, meats, and corpses, allowing filtering of pets, farm animals and more.\n\nAny filter can be disabled in the settings menu.\n\nThis mod can be added or removed from a savegame at any time without issue.</description>
