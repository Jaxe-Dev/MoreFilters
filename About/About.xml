  <description>This mod adds several new filters to item lists to make it easier to customize your stockpiles and bills.\n\nCurrently, the following filters can be selected/deselected:\n\n*Rottable (all items that can rot unless frozen)\n*Degradable (all items that will deteriorate unless under shelter)\n\nAlso for Weapons and Apparel, filters are added for each tech level so for example you can quickly make a Smelt Weapon bill that only affects medieval weapons.\n\nThis mod can be added or removed from a savegame at any time without issue.</description>
